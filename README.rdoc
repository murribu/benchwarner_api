== Benchwarner API

The plan is to develop an API that can serve as an engine for the Benchwarner idea.

That idea is to organize a person's fantasy sports teams. Starting with baseball.

A person will be "warned" when they're "bench"ing a player who's starting - or vice versa.

This current exists at benchwarner.com in a very beta way.
